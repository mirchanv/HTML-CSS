# What is Semantic HTML?

Semantic HTML is the use of HTML tags that clearly define the purpose of the content they enclose to make your website code more understandable for both developers and search engines.

These HTML tags are also called semantic elements. And provide a meaningful description of the content's role within a webpage.

For example, `<header>` is a semantic HTML tag. It encloses the header section (introductory content) at the top of the page.

You can see this and some other common semantic HTML tags below:
