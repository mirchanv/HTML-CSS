# HTML Boilerplate

A HTML boilerplate serves as a foundation, providing all the required HTML tags for working webpage. It is a starting point that ensures best practices and compatibility across different browsers.

## HTML Structure / Boilerplate

```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- content of webpage -->
  </body>
</html>

```

Let us go through each an every line in this HTML boilerplate and really understand what each tag is meant for.

# Doctype Declaration

All HTML documents must start with a `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration. The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect. The most common doctype for modern web development is HTML5:

```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

# HTML Tag

The `<html>` tag is the root element of an HTML document. All other tags must be enclosed within the `<html> </html>` tags.

# Head Tag

The `<head>` tags contain information that is processed by machines. Inside the `<head>` tags, you will nest metadata which is data that describes the document to the machine.

# Title Tag

The `<title>` tag is the title for the web page. This text is shown in the browser's tab.

# Body Tag

The `<body>` tag defines the document's body.

The `<body>` element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.

**Note:** There can only be one `<body>` element in an HTML document.
